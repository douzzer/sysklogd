sysklogd (2.4.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Add support for secure_mode=[0,1,2] to syslog.conf, same as -s
    but easier to use and activate with SIGHUP
  * Enable secure_mode=1 (only log to remote servers) in default syslog.conf
  * Disable debug messages, in default syslog.conf, from /var/log/syslog
  * Rename option -K to -t for trusting kernel timestamp, issue #42
  * Add option -K to disable kernel logging, issue #48
  * Rudimentary support for detecting if running in a container and then
    disable kernel logging automatically, issue #48
  * Add support for notify PATH option to syslog.conf, for calling an
    external script on log rotation, by Steffen Nurpmeso, issue #45
  * Add support for log rotation on SIGUSR2, by Steffen Nurpmeso, issue #46
  * Update manual page for -b option description
  * Add missing -H option to usage text
  * Fix misspelled option in man page
  * Do not lose file mode on rotated files, by Steffen Nurpmeso
  * Verify kernel log FIFO is a proper character device, for running in
    certain container setups
  * Add support for -8 command line option to allow 8-bit data to be
    logged -- this is a temporary fix until we have support for parsing
    the Unicode BOM, as defined in RFC5424
  * Fix issue with wall message, by Edward K. McGuire

sysklogd (2.3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Support for `logger -k`, early log to /dev/kmsg.  Useful when logging
    from early system startup scripts before syslogd has started
  * Support for extracting non-kernel log messages from /dev/kmsg
  * Ignore EINVAL from kernel, caused warning message at first startup
  * Add support for `syslogd -C file` to use `file` for caching
    the last seen kernel sequence number, default: /run/syslogd.cache
  * Fix regression from v2.2.3, causing loss of syslogd log messages
    like `syslogd v2.2.3: restart.`
  * Fix man page, listed `-v` as verbose mode, is actually version
  * Fix man page, missing documentation for `-H` option
  * Fix DNS lookup handling of remote syslog servers, call res_init()
    before getaddrinfo() and re-check more often than every 180 sec.
  * Add option `-K` to trust kernel timestamps after startup
  * Avoid asserting (exiting) on and around Jan 19, 2038, UNIX epoch
    wraparound on 32-bit systems.  Also, handle `EOVERFLOW` from the
    gettimeofday() function in libsyslog
  * Avoid NULL pointers in internal logging functions when in debug mode
  * Replace `\m` with `\n` (missing newline) in `logger` usage text
  * Use systemd KillMode=process
  * Let syslogd use another socket when journald is active (systemd systems)

sysklogd (2.2.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix problem with log messages stuck in 1969.  When not using libsyslog,
    or the bundled logger, the syslog() API in the C library is used, which
    may not necessarily set the timestamp.  When sysklogd infers timestamp
    it was offset by the number of years since 1969, i.e., boot_time.
  * Fix problem with repeating kernel messages if syslogd is restarted.
    This introduces a new state file, /var/run/syslogd.cache, which saves
    the last seen/logged sequence id read from `/dev/kmsg`
  * Fix log message time calculation issue on 32-bit systems.
  * Fix remote kernel messages being mapped to uucp instead of user
  * Fix man page syslogd(8), name of PID file (syslog.pid -> syslogd.pid)

sysklogd (2.2.2) stable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Fix issue with parsing /dev/kmsg time
  * Fix spelling issues in syslogd and man pages, found by lintian
  * Load and reload timezone, with tzset(), on init/SIGHUP.
